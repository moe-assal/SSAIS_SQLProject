# SSAIS Database
The Social Security Administration Information System (SSAIS) is a comprehensive database designed to
efficiently manage various information related to workers, employers, Social Security accounts,
appeal processes, online services, and Medicare programs.
# Design Process
The project started with a requirement analysis of the Social Security Administration. After outlining the 
needs, an ER model was designed. The ER model was implemented on MySQL (see `PROTOTYPE.sql`). The database 
was populated with junk data for testing purposes (see `DATA.sql`). Sample Queries and some Advanced Functionalities
were later implemented as well.
